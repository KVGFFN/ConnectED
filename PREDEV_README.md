# ConnectED
## What is this?
This is a personal project i decided to make because i felt like my general fullstack knowledge wasnt strong enough. I wanted to challenge myself by introducing myself to new technologies, frameworks, tools i havent used to its full extent, if at all.

ConnectED will be a school platform application. The reason i chose for this is because i believe this to be best suited to go through the most important aspects a fullstack application has to offer. Such as:
- Authentication & Authorization
- Security
- Performance
- Responsive, user-friendly design

Another reason i chose for a school platform application was because i didnt like the school platform the college i graduated from provided :)

## What do school learning platforms do wrong?
The end users (teachers and students) must be able to interact with this application easily. Ofcourse that is self-explanatory, but the mistake my previous college's learning platform made was just being unclear. Let me list some issues me, and my other classmates had at the time:

### Deadlines
**WHAT WAS**<br>
The average college student procrastinates. That is the harsh reality. The problem with my old college's learning platform was that students were notified of deadlines, BUT this was displayed in a very tiny bell in the top right corner of the homepage. The problem is that same bell is used for simple notifications about the platform updating or a school event happening.

**WHAT WOULDVE BEEN BETTER**<br>
Important and miscellaneous notifications MUST be seperated from eachother, but clearly visible to the user. The most logical location therefore would be at the homepage of the student.

### Calendar
**WHAT WAS**<br>
The calendar was hidden behind a button, which is not very intuitive for a student.

**WHAT WOULDVE BEEN BETTER**<br>
A calendar displayed at the homepage. Easily displaying assignments or exams of the student without the user having to navigate to a seperate tab.

### Communication
**WHAT WAS**<br>
There was no way to communicate with teachers in the platform. Which is an issue, because the biggest difficulty me and my classmates faced in school was that teachers **required** you to reach out to them on EITHER
- Teams
- E-Mail
- In person

Some teachers would directly tell you that they will NOT respond to your messages if it was not sent to them in their messaging method of preference.

**WHAT WOULDVE BEEN BETTER**<br>
A chatbox IN the platform for students and teachers to communicate with eachother. This would not require students or teachers to have to navigate to an entirely different application purely for a question about an assignment.

## How do you expect your application look like?

### Design
**Straightforward** -
The UI/UX has to be as straight forward as possible. Students need a direct overview of everything that is essential.

**Attractive** -
Just because its a school platform, doesnt mean it has to be devoid of any good looks. The platform will use dark mode, because of the following:
- Reduces eye strain
- Reduces blue light
- Increases readability

### Main functionalities
**Calendar** - The user has to have an overview of upcoming days along with their activities

**Chatbox** - Realtime communication between students and teachers

**Course Overview** - Teachers are able to add courses, students are able to view them

### Used frameworks
**dotNET + PostgreSQL - Backend**<br>
I will make use of dotNET for the backend infrastructure of the application along with postgresql. .NET is a framework i have experience in, so i want to polish it. As for PostgreSQL, i have no prior experience with PostgreSQL, but heard it was community driven and in high demand in the job market. So i believe it wont be an issue to learn.

**Angular - Frontend**<br>
Angular is a javascript framework i have experience in. But i believe i have much to learn, especially with the introduction of new concepts in angular v17 such as conditional flows and signals. These will be used in the project.
